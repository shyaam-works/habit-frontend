# HabitTracker

**HabitTracker** — A beautifully designed habit tracking application that transforms consistency into visual art.

## The Core Idea

Consistency should feel rewarding.  
The longer you maintain a habit, the darker and richer its color becomes across heatmaps and charts — turning dedication into an evolving, elegant visual story.

This progressive color deepening is the central motivation of HabitTracker: your commitment gradually paints a more striking and meaningful picture.

## What Sets HabitTracker Apart

Many habit trackers rely on badges, notifications, or streak pressure to drive engagement.  
HabitTracker takes a different approach: it uses beauty as motivation.

Progress is not just counted — it is visualized in a way that grows more impressive with every consistent day. The deepening colors create a personal, evolving artwork that reflects sustained effort.

No aggressive gamification. No judgment for missed days.  
Just quiet, powerful visual reinforcement that makes long-term consistency feel natural and rewarding.

**Build consistency. Watch it deepen.**
